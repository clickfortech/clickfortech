## Dell XPS 13 Plus

Dell XPS 13 Plus launched with a flat touchpad and palm resting place below the
keyboard. There is no physical division on the sides of the touchpad. So the
portion below the keyboard looks like a flat bar. Dell calls it as a “Haptic
ForcePad”. When a click happens on it, there is no physical depress happens,
instead it reproduces a sensation of depressing. But for initial days it would
be a little hard to identify the edges of the touchpad, but after a while of
usage it would be easier. This design of the touchpad looks stunning.

Dell replaces the physical function keys row with a capacitive touch. These are
just a little LED buttons on a flat bar. And the keyboard is edge to edge.

Flat Function key row, edge to edge keyboard and a flat bar for palm rest with
touchpad makes this edition of XPS 13 one of the best in look.

XPS 13 Plus is powered by 12th Gen Intel processors. And the display will be
available on both FHD and OLED 4K. Along with this the regular Dell XPS 13 with
regular keyboard and touchpad also would be available this year.

## HP Elite Dragonfly G3 and HP Elite Dragonfly Chromebook.

Dragonfly G3 has a change in aspect ratio compared to its predecessor Dragonfly
G2; it is now with a 3:2 display rather than 16:9. Good for a Creative
Professional and general user, but bad for a Software Programmer. G2 was a
2-in-1 type, but the G3 is not a 2-in-1. It comes with 12th Gen Intel processors
with vPro support. Storage and memory options are available upto 2TB and 32GB.
It comes with a 68Wh battery.

The Dragonfly Chromebook laptop is the first Chromebook in this lineup, comes
with a haptic trackpad, a Sure View Reflect privacy screen (prevents sensitive
information visible on the computer screen for the onlookers from the sides)
and a fingerprint sensor. Storage and memory options are available upto 512GB
and 32GB. It comes with a 51Whr battery. It might come with an inexpensive
pricing tag.

Both the Dragonfly laptops will be available in March/April. Pricings are not
revealed, but it is not going to be cheap.
