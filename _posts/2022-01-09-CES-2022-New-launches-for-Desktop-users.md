Razer introduces a prototype of a Modular Table Computer called Razer Sophia.
It is a table with four legs and on top of that there is a modular slot for
building a high performant PC. And a 65 inch or 75 inch display is attached to
it. So it is a table with an attached computer and monitor. What a fantastic
concept for a PC enthusiast.

This module table has 13 swappable module slots for plug and play PC components.
These modules can be a secondary screen, PC temperature monitors, calendar
displays, wireless Qi chargers, a mug heater, pen tablets, audio mixers, CPU and
GPU monitors and much more. This modular nature helps users to customize based
on their needs. This reminds me of Googleâ€™s failure project Modular Smartphone
Ara.

## Intel Core i9 12900KS
Intel has launched the Core i9 12900KS processor at CES 2022, which can run on
5.5 GHz clock speed on a single core. And it can run on 5.2 GHz clock speed on
all cores.

## AMD 5nm Ryzen 7000 Desktop Processors
AMD showcased 5nm Ryzen 7000 Desktop processors with Zen 4 architecture, and it
will be available in the second half of 2022. This will be using the new AM5
socket.

Along with this AMD showcased an upgraded version of its Ryzen 5000 line up
processor, called Ryzen 7 5800X3D. It is using 3D V-Cache technology. It is a
7nm node with AM4 socket support.
