Non Fungible Tokens (NFT) is a kind of application that runs over Blockchain
technology. Non Fungible means something unique which cannot be replaced with
something else. Cryptocurrencies are Fungible tokens. Non Fungible Token
represents a unique piece of digital art such as digital picture, music or
video. These digital pictures can be either shot using a camera or created
artistically using Software. When someone creates a unique digital content, he
can create a NFT for it by adding that content file to a blockchain, which
cannot be copied, edited or deleted. And it can be sold to the interested
buyers. NFT is an evolution of the fine art auction system.
