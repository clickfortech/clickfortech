[Jack Sweeney](https://twitter.com/JxckSweeney), a 19 year old college student made a deal of $5000 with Elon Musk for shutting down his twitter account [@ElonJet](https://twitter.com/ElonJet) which automatically tweets the location details of Elon’s private jet. He wrote a software program to parse the data, publicly available about the flying path of all the flights in ADS-B Exchange. Sweeney uses the flight’s latitude to determine whether the flight has landed or not. But it doesn’t show any information about future paths of the flights.

Jack Sweeney created 15 such auto-bot twitter handles to auto-tweet 15 different celebrity’s private jet paths. Elon Musk felt this could be a security risk, so he contacted Jack Sweeney to shut this down. During the conversation Must asked about how much money Sweeney made using that account. Sweeney replied as $20. And Elon Musk proposed an offer to the college going teenager of USD 5000 to shut this down.
