Firewall is an essential part of every network, which examines all incoming
packets and blocks malicious packets.

## Firewall
Traditionally firewalls run in between a trusted internal network and an
untrusted network (Internet) and monitors the incoming (ingress) traffic to
the internal network and outgoing (egress) traffic from the internal network.
Firewall blocks or allows traffic based on the rules configured. Network
administrator holds the control of maintaining the Firewall rules. The border
between a trusted network and the Internet is called as Network Perimeter.
Traditional Firewalls are either in the form of Software or Hardware.

## Cloud Firewall
A cloud firewall, as the name suggests, is a firewall thatâ€™s deployed in the
cloud and also called as FWaaS (Firewall as a Service). This sits on the cloud
to protect the cloud resources. Cloud resources are scattered in various
data centres. So the Cloud Firewall forms a Virtual Network Perimeter among
all those cloud resources of a particular organization and protects against
any traffic. Cloud Firewalls can also be used to protect on premise resources.

### Advantages of Cloud Firewall
- Easy to deploy
- Quick to scale
- High availability, automated backups, and hassle-free maintenance
- Streamlined access control
- Supportive of multiple cloud deployments

### Downside of Cloud Firewall
- No complete control
- Not optimizable
- Advanced feature can slow down access to the resources
- Delay or Downtime of a cloud provider would affect Firewall Maintenance and
Monitoring.
